# Destiny Solitaire

**Destiny Solitaire** is a thematic reimagining of the classic Klondike Solitaire, set within the sprawling sci-fi universe of Destiny. Master the paracausal forces, organize the chaos of the Darkness, and channel the Light to clear the board.

## 🃏 The Elemental Suits

The deck is comprised of the four fundamental elements that define the struggle between Light and Dark:

### Light

- 🟠 **Solar** – The burning fury of the Light. Represented by searing orange hues and the power of suns.
- 🟣 **Void** – The mysterious pull of the vacuum. Deep purples that signify gravity and the space between stars.

### Darkness

- 🔵 **Stasis** – The rigid, cold control of the Darkness. Shimmering blue crystals that freeze entropy.
- 🟢 **Strand** – The emerald green threads of consciousness. A psychic tapestry that connects all living things.
